## Made for Calva's Getting Started REPL

This is a repository for **Getting Started** files for Calva. 

*NB: This feature is not yet released.* Check out [this pull request](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/pull/1041) to build a version of Calva with the feature included. (Or pick up the VSIX from Circle CI.)

That said `hello_clojure.clj` should be usable from in any REPL connected editor.
